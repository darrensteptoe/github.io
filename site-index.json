Open profile ↗ The Last to Know (2022) Join 89-year-old retired educator and community activist, Dr. Opal Lee (often referred to as the “Grandmother of Juneteenth”), as she begins a years-long campaign to make her vision of Juneteenth becoming a federally-recognized holiday a reality. My Roles: Co-producer, Co-writer, Editor Released: March 19, 2022 Directed by Erica Stevenson 🏆 Founder’s Best Story Award — The African Film Festival (TAFF) 🏆 Audience Award for Best Documentary — The Black Film Summit Nominee, Best Editing — Oregon Documentary Film Festival Academic and Institutional Work Homeless PhotoVoice Project During my AmeriCorps VISTA service with the Homeless Coalition of Hillsborough County, I developed and led the Homeless PhotoVoice Project, a community-based applied sociology initiative. I designed the project and approached University of Tampa professor Norma Winston to integrate it into her Applied Sociology course. The project became a core part of the curriculum, engaging students in fieldwork, media coordination, and a public PhotoVoice showcase focused on homelessness in Tampa. The project was later documented as a case example in National Service and Volunteerism (Bloomsbury) ↗ . © Darren Steptoe Privacy | Terms | Refund",

    "content": "Writing Pages When Good Intentions Fail Back Cover Excerpt Early Reader Feedback Release Notes Writing — Darren Steptoe Skip to content Writing Forthcoming work and excerpts Pages Forthcoming When Good Intentions Fail How Institutions Quietly Transfer Burden COMING SOON Back Cover Values-driven institutions often look humane on the surface: careful language, collaborative norms, and a shared sense of mission. But when roles, authority, and decision-making stay unfinished, responsibility doesn’t disappear. It relocates into ambiguity, informal expectations, and the people most willing to carry the load. Over time, “being reliable” becomes a job requirement. Exhaustion becomes normal. And the system keeps functioning precisely because someone keeps compensating. When Good Intentions Fail names the pattern clearly—without drama—and gives readers a way to recognize where the burden went, why it landed there, and how to stop mistaking personal strain for personal failure. Excerpt Most institutions begin with language—mission statements, values decks, guiding principles. Early on, those words attract people who care and create a sense of shared purpose. But eventually, values have to become structure: roles, authority, process, and protection. When that translation never fully happens, values start doing work they were never designed to do. “Values can guide decisions. They cannot carry them.” Early Reader Feedback “Bravo! Excellent read—extremely relatable, without being emotionally heavy.” — Harmony “You are a very good writer. I’m impressed by how effective your sentences are—enough words to make an interesting point, but not overly flowery.” — Griffith Release Notes The book is currently unpublished.
