Over time, “being reliable” becomes a job requirement. Exhaustion becomes normal. And the system keeps functioning precisely because someone keeps compensating. When Good Intentions Fail names the pattern clearly—without drama—and gives readers a way to recognize where the burden went, why it landed there, and how to stop mistaking personal strain for personal failure. Excerpt Most institutions begin with language—mission statements, values decks, guiding principles. Early on, those words attract people who care and create a sense of shared purpose.
