            <h3>What this book is</h3>
            <p>
              This is a short book about a common pattern in values-driven places:
              when structure stays unfinished, the weight doesn’t disappear — it moves.
              It settles into ambiguity, becomes “flexibility,” and eventually becomes someone’s job.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s written for people who can feel the load but keep getting told to manage it better:
              translate unclear direction, absorb risk without authority, and hold things together
              while the language stays inspiring and the design stays the same.
            </p>

                Chapter 1 — Values Are Not Structure
              </p>

              <p style="margin:0 0 12px;">
                Most institutions begin with language. Mission statements. Values decks. Guiding principles.
                These words tend to show up early, before systems have hardened, before anyone really knows
                how the work will feel once it’s underway.
              </p>

              <p style="margin:0 0 12px;">
                That language matters. It draws in people who care. It sets a tone. It creates a sense of shared
                purpose before anything concrete exists to test it.
              </p>

              <p style="margin:0 0 12px;">
                But language can only do so much.
              </p>

              <p style="margin:0;">
                At some point, values have to become structure. They have to show up as roles, as authority,
                as process, as protection. When that translation never quite happens, values start doing work
                they were never designed to do.
