      <h2 class="h2">When Good Intentions Fail</h2>
      <p><em>How Institutions Quietly Transfer Burden</em></p>

      <p>
        This book examines a recurring pattern in values-driven institutions:
        when structure remains incomplete, responsibility does not disappear.
        It relocates into ambiguity, informal expectations, and eventually
        into the people most willing to carry it.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is written for people asked to translate unclear direction, absorb
        risk without authority, and sustain systems whose language remains
        aspirational while their design stays unresolved.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Excerpt -->
    <section class="panel" aria-label="Excerpt">
      <h2 class="h2">Excerpt</h2>

      <p>
        Most institutions begin with language. Mission statements. Values decks.
        Guiding principles. These words appear early, before systems harden and
        before anyone knows how the work will feel once it is underway.
      </p>

      <p>
        That language matters. It attracts people who care. It establishes tone.
        It creates alignment before anything concrete exists to test it.
      </p>

      <p>
        But language cannot carry weight.
      </p>

      <p>
        At some point, values must become structure — roles, authority, process,
        and protection. When that translation never fully occurs, values begin
        doing work they were never designed to do.
