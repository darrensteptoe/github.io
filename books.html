            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              This book examines a recurring pattern in values-driven institutions:
              when structure remains incomplete, responsibility does not disappear.
              It relocates — into ambiguity, into informal expectations, and eventually
              into the people most willing to carry it.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is written for people asked to translate unclear direction, absorb risk
              without authority, and sustain systems whose language remains aspirational
              while their design stays unresolved.
            </p>

            <h3>Excerpt</h3>
            <div class="reading">
              <p>
                Most institutions begin with language. Mission statements. Values decks.
                Guiding principles. These words appear early, before systems harden and
                before anyone knows how the work will feel once it is underway.
              </p>
              <p>
                That language matters. It attracts people who care. It establishes tone.
                It creates alignment before anything concrete exists to test it.
              </p>
              <p>
                But language cannot carry weight.
              </p>
              <p>
                At some point, values must become structure — roles, authority, process,
                and protection. When that translation never fully occurs, values begin
                doing work they were never designed to do.
